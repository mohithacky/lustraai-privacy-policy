  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 2025</p>

  <p>
    Lustra AI (“we”, “our”, or “us”) operates the Lustra AI mobile application (“App”).
    This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure
    of personal data when you use our App and the choices you have associated with that data.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    Our app may collect the following information:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Email address and authentication details (via Firebase)</li>
    <li>Profile-related information (optional)</li>
    <li>Photos or media uploaded by the user (if applicable)</li>
    <li>Payment information such as transaction ID or payment status (via Razorpay)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>
    We use your data solely to provide and improve the app’s functionality, such as:
    authentication, personalized features, saving your preferences, and securely processing
    payments for premium or paid services.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We value your trust in providing your information. We use secure cloud storage and
    encryption (via Firebase and Firestore). All financial transactions are processed
    securely by Razorpay using industry-standard encryption. However, no method of
    transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    Our app uses third-party services (such as Firebase and Razorpay) that may collect
    information used to identify you. Please review their privacy policies for more details:
  </p>

  </ul>

  <h2>5. Payments via Razorpay</h2>
  <p>
    We use Razorpay to process payments. When you make a payment within our app, certain
    details such as your name, email, contact number, and transaction information may be
    shared with Razorpay to complete the transaction. We do not store or have access to
    your credit/debit card details or payment credentials.
  </p>
